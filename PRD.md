## Design Direction

The design should feel modern, sophisticated, and trustworthy - combining the energy of a startup with the reliability of financial infrastructure. Moving completely away from terminal green to embrace a vibrant, gradient-rich aesthetic that feels like a next-generation economic platform. Users should feel confident using it as the foundation for world currency, with every interaction providing clear visual feedback and delightful micro-animations that reinforce security and permanence.

## Color Selection

A bold, vibrant color scheme that combines deep purples and electric blues with energetic accent colors - professional yet exciting.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Purple `oklch(0.45 0.15 300)` - Sophisticated and modern, represents intelligence and creativity
- **Secondary Colors**: Electric Blue `oklch(0.55 0.20 250)` for interactive elements, Soft Lavender `oklch(0.75 0.08 290)` for cards/sections
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Cyan `oklch(0.70 0.18 200)` - High-energy color for CTAs, buttons, and important highlights
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Primary Purple: White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Electric Blue: White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓
  - Vibrant Cyan: Deep Navy `oklch(0.20 0.05 270)` - Ratio 9.1:1 ✓
  - Background: Soft gradient from `oklch(0.95 0.01 280)` to `oklch(0.98 0.01 250)` with subtle mesh pattern

## Font Selection

Typography should balance modern tech aesthetics with readability, using a geometric sans-serif for UI and a friendly sans for content to create approachable sophistication.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Main Title): Space Grotesk Bold / 48px / tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Space Grotesk SemiBold / 32px / normal spacing
  - H3 (Card Titles): Space Grotesk Medium / 24px / normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular / 16px / comfortable line-height (1.6)
  - UI Labels: Inter Medium / 14px / slightly tight spacing (-0.01em)
  - Code/Data: JetBrains Mono / 14px / monospace feel for technical elements

## Animations

Animations should create a sense of fluid intelligence - smooth transitions that feel responsive without delay, with special attention to data visualization animations that show information flowing and connecting. Use spring physics for interactive elements (buttons, cards) and smooth easing for transitions. Graph nodes should gently pulse, search results should cascade in with stagger, and the slot machine should have satisfying mechanical momentum.
